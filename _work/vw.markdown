    content="We worked with VW to build the concept from the ground up. In its initial phase, we focused on the selling of previously leased VWs and Audis. We identified existing car buying journeys and how our product could best alleviate points of friction, translated the VW group brand (including VW, Audi, And Porsche) into distinct style directions, and built prototypes and journeys to test our assumptions."

    content="To accompany the launch of the upcoming electric vehicle line, we worked with VW to take this initial concept and craft the experience to support three main experiences along an end-to-end customer experience. We worked to support reservations prior to vehicle production, crafted an experience to keep reservation-holders engaged through progress and key interaction points, and brought the dealership to the consumer through an entirely online buying experience."

    content="One of the biggest challenges for this work was to bring stability and a singular creative approach across multiple teams. The teams spanned across VW/Audi client teams and ISL/Wunderman Thompson agency teams, to create one serious nest of talented humans. I created and maintained a design system that interprets a new VW brand direction, oversaw the interaction design with multiple teams of designers, and worked closely with multiple product owners and a release train engineer to ensure a delivery and review schedule that facilitated stakeholder feedback and set the developer teams up for success."
