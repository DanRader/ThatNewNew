The Charcoal Looped Serving Bowl is handmade on the potterâ€™s wheel using a beige colored stoneware and glazed in our Charcoal colored  glaze.  We love this bowl because it is multi-functional and makes a bold statement on the dinner table both during the meal, as a bowl for serving your favorite dish and after as a sculptural vessel that will bring panache to any table or shelf.
